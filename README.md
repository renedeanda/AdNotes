# AdNotes
AdNotes Android App in Kotlin

AdNotes is a digital marketing app to create text ads from your mobile phone in the form of expanded text ads. Includes CSV export & dark/light themes.

You can download the app here on the Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dcrtns.adnotebook

I made this app in one week a few years back when seeking my first Android job. It was an idea that sprung from my love of marketing & desire to create simple clean apps. I've updated it minimally over the last few years & also converted the entire app from Java to Kotlin.

Feel free to use & I'm open to PRs for anyone that would like to improve the app.

One of my goals was to use the app as an opportunity to learn proper migration from SQLiteOpenHelper to Room but I just never got there. There are many opportunities to improve the app for current Android best practices today.
